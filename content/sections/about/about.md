<u>Hi, I’m Joseph.</u> I like creating and discovering new things, on the page, on the computer, and out in the world. 

Currently I'm working as a graphic designer & web developer at <a target="_blank" href="https://moxielearning.com">Moxie Media</a>, and I get to work on as many exciting projects and tangle with as many stimulating ideas as when I worked as a teacher for almost 2 decades.

I dig words and language, and I spend a lot of time reading, writing, translating, and performing poetry, but image, typography, and color are important to me too. 

In the best design and the best writing the teeming influences, experiences, and interests swimming in teh world converge to make something intricate and meaningful that speaks to everyone. 

That’s what I’m always striving to do, whether I’m writing a poem, designing a poster, flier, chapbook, or website, recording a podcast, writing a script, or making a video.

I just wish there were more hours in the day, so I’d have time to develop all the projects I cook up. I’m always down for freelance work or to collaborate, so feel free to <a href="mailto:me@josephbienvenu.com">get in touch</a>. :)
