In Atom Parlor's hooting forest is a beating heart, crying out for connection, vulnerable, human, demonstrative of an extraordinary associational speed, the imagination always in triumph, in celebration as well as sorrow, dire and slapstick, and, dare I say, fun.❞",

Bienvenu responds directly and freshly to every nuance in every genre represented in the original text, from epigram, to lyric, to elegy and epyllion. It comes as as no surprise to me, though surely a delight to savor, that it has taken a New Orleans poet to truly lock eyebrows with the most passionate and genuine Latin poet of antiquity❞",
